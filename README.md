### Description

Dear fellows, this is an Inventory Management System with Access Database on backend. It has been developed on 4 Input forms i.e Accounts, Purchases, Sales and Transactions and many reports i.e Purchase Reports (Date Wise / Supplier Wise / Product Wise), Sales Reports (Date Wise / Customer Wise / Product Wise), Accounts Reports (Accounts Status / Accounts Ledger), Stock Reports (Stock Status / Price List / Reorder Level / Product to Reorder), Financial Reports (Trial Balance / Income Statement) . No Data Environment used for reporting. Not 3rd Party control used. There should be some bugs in it as I am not so expert in Coding. If you face any error/bug please try to resolve it and also inform me on my email address hafizm.farooq@hotmail.com. Also mention the bug/Fixes in Comments so everybody can check and fix it. Do not delete Values from Table ACCOUNT_HEADS and first column Value of Table MAX_CODES. If you like this project, please Vote for me.
